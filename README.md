# OpenSanctions Learning Portfolio

Hey! 👋 This is my personal playground for learning how to work with OpenSanctions and Zavod.

## What I’m Doing Here

I’m using this repo to:

- Try out writing crawlers in Python using Zavod.
- Learn by doing, step by step, and track my progress.
- Experiment with LLM tools (ChatGPT, Copilot) as a kind of coding buddy — helping me understand stuff instead of just copy-pasting.

## What’s in the Repo

- `portfolio/test_crawler.py` — my first small crawler script. Nothing fancy yet, but it’s where I’m learning how to fetch and structure sample data.

## Notes

- The full `opensanctions` and `zavod` packages aren’t here — just my experiments.
- Think of this as a learning diary that shows how I go from rusty Python to actually doing junior-level data crawling.
